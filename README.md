**Project Title: Face Recognition Attendance System** 
### **Overview:**
Build a comprehensive Face Recognition-based Attendance Management System for students, teachers, and admins. The system must support registration, facial recognition attendance, manual overrides, dashboards, and dynamic subject/semester control.
### **1. Student Module**
#### **Student Registration:**
* Students can register using face recognition.
* After successful face detection, students must fill in their personal details:
* Full Name

* College Roll Number

* Email Address

* Academic Year

* Semester (Select from 1 to 8)

* Based on the selected semester, dynamically display:
* List of subjects

* Assigned subject teachers

* Automatically capture and display the current date and day.

 
#### **Attendance Marking:**

 

* Students can mark their attendance through face recognition.

* After successful face match:

 

* Student selects the subject

* Corresponding teacher is displayed

* Submit attendance

 

#### **Manual Attendance Entry:**

 

* Provide an alternative manual form to mark attendance (admin or teacher-assisted) using:

 

* Name

* Roll Number

* Email

* Semester

* Subject

* Option to submit

 

#### **Student Dashboard:**

 

* Display:

 

* Personal details

* Attendance summary

* Subject list

* Teachers assigned

* Attendance history (sortable by date/subject)

* Notifications from teachers/admin

### **2. Teacher Module**

 

#### **Teacher Registration:**

 

* Register via form with fields:

 

* Full Name

* Email (Optional)

* Mobile Number

* Select Subject(s)

* Assigned Semester(s)

* Class Time(s)

* Option to **"Add Another Subject"** dynamically

* Option to specify **Lab Assignments**:

 

* Choose: “Are you assigned any lab?” (Yes/No)

* If **Yes**, allow:

 

* Lab Subject Name

* Multiple Day Selection

* Lab Timings

* If **No**, proceed to submit

 

#### **Teacher Dashboard:**

 

* View all registered semesters and subjects.

* Access a **Semester Page** with the following features:

 

* List of all students enrolled in the semester

* Full control to **edit**, **add**, or **remove** student entries

 

#### **Student Communication:**

 

* Send email notifications to:

 

* Individual students

* Selected students

* All students (bulk selection option)

 

#### **Attendance Management:**

 

* View attendance entries in a tabular format:

 

```

S.No | Name | Roll Number | Phone | Email | Date1 | Date2 | ... | Date_n

```

* Features include:

 

* Filter by attendance status (present/absent/unmarked)

* Edit attendance records

* Add new rows/columns dynamically

* Export attendance data to **Excel** or **PDF**

* Attendance change notifications with reason sent to students

 

#### **Semester Settings:**

 

* Edit semester details (subject list, teachers, schedule)

* Enable or disable manual attendance marking for students

 

#### **Notifications:**

 

* View real-time alerts for newly marked attendances

* Track changes made to attendance with timestamps and messages

 

---

 

### **3. Admin Module**

 

* Full administrative control

* Access to all student, teacher, and attendance records

* Can update, delete, and manage users

* Monitor all modules and generate reports

* Override or manage system-wide settings (face recognition thresholds, backup settings, etc.)

 

---

 

### **Technology Stack:**

 

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

* **Backend**: Python with Django or Flask

* **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL). If Supabase is unavailable, fallback to a local PostgreSQL setup

* **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

* **Face Recognition**: Use appropriate libraries (e.g., OpenCV, face\_recognition)

 

---

 

### **Optional Enhancements:**

 

* Audit logs for attendance and student edits

* Charts for attendance trends

* Push/email notifications for schedule changes

* Offline support for local attendance marking (sync when online)
